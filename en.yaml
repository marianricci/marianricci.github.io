  - As a member of the Spanish-speaking community living in Australia and also as a mental health professional, <em>I understand the challenges of undertaking therapy in a language different from one's native tongue</em>. For this reason, I offer my psychotherapy services in <strong>Spanish</strong> with the goal of providing maximum comfort and ensuring excellent service in times of difficulty or crisis, or even if you simply wish to develop your resources and values in the pursuit of a more fulfilling life.

My therapeutic style is compassionate, relaxed, respectful, and non-judgmental, with strict confidentiality.<br>My psychotherapeutic approach involves working together to provide a genuine, empathetic, and mutual understanding of personal difficulties, focusing on personal growth, enriching, and enhancing the meaning of relationships with oneself and others.

  - title: Adults
    text: The goal of treatment is to increase the understanding of the sources of our internal conflicts and emotional problems. This approach allows the patient to set the pace of the sessions while the therapist provides opportunities for greater understanding and better decision-making.

  - title: Children
    text: Play is the child's language, which, when used therapeutically, allows them to master situations that cause suffering. It is also a means of communication and a way to express desires, fears, and concerns. Children require the support and commitment of their parents for therapy to achieve the best results.

  whatis:
    title: What do psychological therapies consist of?
    text:
    - The therapies I offer focus on dealing with distressing feelings and thoughts and understanding how a person feels, thinks, and acts. Sometimes these problems stem from past traumas or from a person’s relationship with themselves, which may be negatively affecting current relationships, self-image, and self-worth. Through this process, we will explore in-depth beliefs, significant life events, themes, and recurring patterns that have emerged throughout your personal history.
    - Psychotherapy will help you gain a deeper understanding and a clearer internal perspective of your personal problems, so you can identify more resilient ways of coping with difficulties or even change certain aspects of yourself or your life.

    title: Frequently Asked Questions
    content:
    - question: How can I access Medicare benefits?
      answer: To access Medicare Better Access Mental Health reimbursements, you need to request a mental health plan from your general practitioner, in the name of the mental health provider you choose. This allows the doctor to approve a set number of sessions (initially 6, with the possibility of extending up to 10 per year). The reimbursement will only cover a portion of the total session cost.
    - question: How long do sessions last?
      answer: Each session lasts approximately 50 minutes.
    - question: How often should I go to therapy?
      answer: Usually once a week; however, this can be discussed based on individual needs.
    - question: How many sessions will I need?
      answer: The duration of therapy varies for each person and depends on the goals set. Short therapies (6 - 10 sessions) are mainly used for specific issues or learning strategies. Longer periods are needed for deeper psychological issues, long-term difficulties, and ingrained behavioral patterns. The duration of your therapy will be evaluated and discussed in the first session.
